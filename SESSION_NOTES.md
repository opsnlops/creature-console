# Session Notes — Live Magic workstream

- Brought AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md guidance back into focus (liquid glass emphasis, testing expectations) and reread instructions about Live Magic + ad-hoc tooling.
- Verified current state of both codebases: `cd Common && swift build`, `cd Common && swift test`, and `xcodebuild -project "Creature Console.xcodeproj" -scheme "Creature Console" -destination "platform=macOS" build` all succeed locally.
- Re-familiarized with the new Live Magic implementation (`Sources/Creature Console/View/LiveMagic/…`) and the Common server client/DTO updates for ad-hoc animations & sounds.
- Confirmed newest work already includes viewing ad-hoc assets, downloading/playing ad-hoc sounds locally, and opening ad-hoc animations inside `AnimationEditor` in read-only mode.
- Outstanding follow-ups: consider surfacing server-side play/stop controls for ad-hoc sounds, decide on additional badges/UI when `AnimationEditor` is read-only, and add targeted tests if more logic lands inside the Live Magic views.
