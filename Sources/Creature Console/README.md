#  macOS / iOS GUI Client

This directory contains the parts of the app that are specific to macOS and iOS.

## SwiftUI

This app uses SwiftUI very heavily.

It is my design goal to leverage as much as I can out of SwiftUI, and use SwiftUI design patterns whenever possible. I try to avoid pulling in ObjectiveC if at all possible.
