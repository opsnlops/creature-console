#  creature-cli

This directory contains the things that are unique to the command line interface. (CLI)

I mostly use this for testing the core libraries, but it has other helpful purposes, too. It's heavily based on Apple's `ArgumentParser` library. Which rocks. I wish all CLI apps were this easy to write! 😍
